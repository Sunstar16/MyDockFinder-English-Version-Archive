# MyDockFinder-English-Version-Archive
Archived version of mydockfinder (from the internet archive) in ENGLISH!

A reupload of version 5.10 (taken from the internet archive's archive of this) EN=English CH=Chinese  I think if you download the sourcecode from the main page of the repository, you might be able to change the language inside the "lang" folder of MyDockFinder (i haven't tried that yet).  To run it, open Dock_64.exe  Enjoy ;) Made by me @Sunstar_16
